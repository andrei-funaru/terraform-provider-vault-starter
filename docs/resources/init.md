Resource for vault starter init

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "vaultstarter_init" "example" {
  secret_shares    = 5
  secret_threshold = 3
}
```

```terraform
data "local_file" "pgp_key" {
    for_each = toset(["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"])
    filename = "${path.module}/${each.key}.gpg"
}

data "local_file" "root_token_pgp_key" {
    filename = "${path.module}/root.gpg"
}

resource "vaultstarter_init" "example" {
  secret_shares    = 5
  secret_threshold = 3
  pgp_keys = data.local_file.pgp_key.*.content_base64
  root_token_pgp_key = data.local_file.root_token_pgp_key.content_base64
}
```

## Schema

### Required

### Optional
- **secret_shares** (Number) Specifies the number of shares to split the master key into.
  - `Default: 5`
- **secret_threshold** (Number) Specifies the number of shares required to reconstruct the master key.
  - `Default: 3`
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **recovery_shares** (Number) Specifies the number of shares to split the recovery key into.
- **recovery_threshold** (Number) Specifies the number of shares required to reconstruct the recovery key.
- **pgp_keys** (List of String) Specifies an array of PGP public keys used to encrypt the output unseal keys. Ordering is preserved. The keys must be base64-encoded from their original binary representation. The size of this array must be the same as **secret_shares**.
- **recovery_pgp_keys** (List of String) Specifies an array of PGP public keys used to encrypt the output recovery keys. Ordering is preserved. The keys must be base64-encoded from their original binary representation. The size of this array must be the same as **recovery_shares**. This is only available when using Auto Unseal.
- **root_token_pgp_key** (String) Specifies a PGP public key used to encrypt the initial root token. The key must be base64-encoded from its original binary representation.

### Read-Only

- **keys** (List of String, Sensitive) The unseal keys. If **pgp_keys** was provided, each unseal key will be encrypted using the corresponding PGP key.
- **keys_base64** (List of String, Sensitive) The unseal keys, base64 encoded.
- **recovery_keys** (List of String, Sensitive) The recovery keys. If **recovery_pgp_keys** was provided, each recovery key will be encrypted using the corresponding recovery PGP key.
- **recovery_keys_base64** (List of String, Sensitive) The recovery keys, base64 encoded.
- **root_token** (String, Sensitive) The Vault Root Token. If **root_token_pgp_key** was provided, it will be encrypted with it and base64 encoded.

## Import

Import is supported from a json file with the Vault API schema:

```json
{
    "keys": [
        "...",
        "..."
    ],
    "keys_base64": [
        "...",
        "..."
    ],
    "root_token": "..."
}
```

Then run:

```bash
terraform import vaultstarter_init.example file://vaultinit.json
```
